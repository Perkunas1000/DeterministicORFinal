# Optimizing Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) for Maximized Transplantation Matches
This project involves designing an optimal Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) plan for the KPD Pilot Program under the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). The goal is to maximize the number of compatible kidney transplantations by matching patients with incompatible donors to other such pairs, facilitating kidney exchanges. Using a provided dataset of incompatible pairs, operations research tools and techniques will be applied to find optimal matchings of sizes two (pairwise exchange) and three (three-way exchange).

## Objectives:

Maximize Transplantation Matches: Identify the highest number of feasible and compatible exchanges between patient-donor pairs.
Develop Transparent Processes: Ensure all steps, data, code, and outputs are fully documented and accessible.
Incorporate Real-World Constraints: Factor in medical compatibility, geographic feasibility, and program-specific limitations in the solution.


## Scope of Work:

### Input Data Analysis:
Analyze the dataset of incompatible patient-donor pairs to extract relevant attributes, such as compatibility scores, geographic locations, and other constraints.
### Mathematical Modeling:
Use operations research techniques (e.g., graph theory, integer programming) to model the problem. Develop algorithms to identify feasible pairwise and three-way exchanges.
### Implementation:
Write and execute the code to find optimal matchings, leveraging tools such as Python, R, or specialized optimization software like Gurobi or CPLEX.
### Evaluation and Validation:
Assess the proposed matches for feasibility and compliance with KPD program objectives.
### Reporting:
Provide comprehensive documentation of the process, including data preparation, algorithm design, results, and justifications for selected KPD plans.

## Significance:
The proposed KPD plan will enhance the efficiency of the kidney exchange program by increasing successful transplantations, reducing waiting times, and improving outcomes for patients with incompatible donors. This work will support the OPTNâ€™s mission to save lives through improved organ matching and allocation strategies.
